🚨 URGENT: FIX 403 FORBIDDEN ERROR
====================================

Your iPhone can't load the app because the files are missing!

---

## 📋 STEP-BY-STEP FIX:

### 1. Login to cPanel
   - https://safecart.app:2083

### 2. Open File Manager
   - Click "File Manager" in cPanel

### 3. Go to public_html
   - Click "public_html" folder in left sidebar

### 4. CHECK WHAT'S THERE:
   - Do you see these folders/files?
     - `_next/` folder
     - `locales/` folder
     - `index.html` file
     - `.htaccess` file

   **If you DON'T see index.html:**
   → You need to upload and extract the zip!

---

## 🚀 UPLOAD THE FILES (DO THIS NOW):

### A. Upload the Zip:
   1. In public_html, click "Upload" button (top toolbar)
   2. Drag `frontend-complete.zip` from your Mac
   3. Wait for "100% complete"
   4. Close upload tab

### B. Extract the Zip:
   1. Back in File Manager, find `frontend-complete.zip`
   2. **Right-click** on the zip file
   3. Select **"Extract"**
   4. Make sure it says: Extract to: `/home/[username]/public_html`
   5. Click **"Extract File(s)"** button
   6. Wait for "Extraction Results"
   7. Click "Close"

### C. Verify Files Extracted:
   1. Refresh File Manager (F5)
   2. You should NOW see:
      ✅ `_next/` folder
      ✅ `locales/` folder
      ✅ `index.html` file
      ✅ `404.html` file
      ✅ `.htaccess` file
      ✅ `manifest.json` file

### D. Delete the Zip:
   1. Select `frontend-complete.zip`
   2. Click "Delete" button
   3. Confirm

### E. Check Permissions (IMPORTANT):
   1. Select `index.html`
   2. Right-click → "Change Permissions"
   3. Make sure it's set to **644** (Owner: Read+Write, Group: Read, World: Read)
   4. Click "Change Permissions"

---

## 📱 TEST ON IPHONE:

1. **Clear Safari cache:**
   - Settings → Safari → Clear History and Website Data

2. **Close Safari completely:**
   - Swipe up and close Safari app

3. **Open Safari and go to:**
   - https://safecart.app

4. **Should work now!** ✅

## 🔍 IF STILL NOT WORKING:

Check in cPanel File Manager:
- Make sure you're in `/public_html` (not a subfolder)
- Make sure `index.html` exists
- Make sure `.htaccess` exists
- Make sure permissions are correct

---

**The issue is simple: The new files aren't on the server yet!**
**Follow steps A-D above to upload and extract them.** 🚀
