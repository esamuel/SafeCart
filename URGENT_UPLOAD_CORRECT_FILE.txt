🚨 YOU UPLOADED THE WRONG FILE!
================================

❌ WRONG: frontend-deploy-fixed.zip (old file)
✅ CORRECT: frontend-deploy-FINAL.zip (NEW file - has API fix)

---

## 🔧 WHY IT'S NOT WORKING:

The old file tries to connect to:
❌ http://safecart.app:5002 (DOESN'T EXIST!)

The NEW file connects to:
✅ https://safecart-backend-j3ry.onrender.com (YOUR RENDER BACKEND)

---

## 🚀 FIX IT NOW - UPLOAD CORRECT FILE:

1. **Go to cPanel → File Manager → public_html**

2. **DELETE all these files again:**
   - `_next/` folder
   - `locales/` folder  
   - All `.html` files
   - `manifest.json`, `icon.svg`, `og-image.svg`, `index.txt`
   - **KEEP .htaccess!**

3. **Upload the CORRECT file:**
   - **FILE NAME: frontend-deploy-FINAL.zip**
   - (I've opened Finder and highlighted it for you)

4. **Extract:**
   - Right-click → Extract → /public_html
   - Delete zip after extraction

5. **Clear phone cache** (IMPORTANT!)
   - iPhone: Settings → Safari → Clear History
   - Android: Chrome → Settings → Clear Data

6. **Test: https://safecart.app**

---

## ✅ HOW TO KNOW IT WORKED:

After upload, open browser console (F12) on desktop:
- ✅ Should see: "https://safecart-backend-j3ry.onrender.com"
- ❌ Should NOT see: "http://safecart.app:5002"

If you still see port 5002, you uploaded the wrong file!
