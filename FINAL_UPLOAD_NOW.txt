🎉 FINAL FIX - Profile Saves Now Work!
=========================================

**File to Upload:** frontend-deploy-FINAL.zip
**What was fixed:** API now connects to Render backend to save profile data

---

## 🚀 QUICK UPLOAD STEPS:

1. **cPanel → File Manager → public_html**

2. **DELETE old files:**
   - `_next/` folder
   - `locales/` folder
   - All `.html` files
   - `manifest.json`, `icon.svg`, `og-image.svg`, `index.txt`
   - **KEEP `.htaccess`!**

3. **Upload:** `frontend-deploy-FINAL.zip`
   - Click "Upload" button
   - Drag the file from Finder

4. **Extract:**
   - Right-click zip → "Extract" → Extract to `/public_html`
   - Delete the zip after extraction

5. **Test on phone:**
   - **IMPORTANT:** Clear browser cache first!
   - iPhone: Settings → Safari → Clear History
   - Android: Chrome → Settings → Privacy → Clear Data
   - Go to: https://safecart.app
   - Login and edit your profile
   - **It should save now!** ✅

---

## 🔧 What Changed:

**Before:** API tried to connect to `http://safecart.app:5002` (doesn't exist)
**After:** API connects to `https://safecart-backend-j3ry.onrender.com` (Render backend)

**Result:** Profile edits will save properly! 🎉

---

## ✅ Expected Behavior:

1. Open app → Login (no auto-profile request)
2. Go to Profile/Settings
3. Edit your data (name, age, allergies, etc.)
4. Click "Save"
5. **Success message appears**
6. **Data is saved to database**
7. Reload page → **Your changes are still there**

---

## 💡 Pro Tip:

Always clear cache on your phone after uploading new files to cPanel!

**Upload now and test! It will work this time!** 🚀
